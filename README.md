# Summary
This project was developed as part of [Boltz.ai](http://boltz.ai) research on resource optimization in agriculture. The goal of this project was to define a problem that could be solved on today's quantum computers, focussing specifically on a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulation that could be run on D-Wave quantum computers.
